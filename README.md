Lua bytecode file viewer  
<hr>

The bytecode viewer is written in pure Lua.  
It's running inside your browser under [Fengari](https://fengari.io/) (Lua interpreter written in JS).  
The bytecode files are not being uploaded somewhere; processing is performed locally.  

The web page works correctly in FireFox and Chrome.  
It doesn't work on some other browsers.  
Help from a Web developer is needed to make this tiny index.html file work on all most popular browsers.
