# lua-bytecode.github.io
Lua bytecode file viewer  
<hr>
This is a demo page for the module "lua-bytecode.lua": https://github.com/Egor-Skriptunoff/lua-bytecode

The **.lua** module is running here under [Fengari](https://fengari.io/) (Lua interpreter written in JS).  
The bytecode files are not being uploaded somewhere; processing is performed locally (inside your browser).  

The web page was tested only in FireFox.
