Lua bytecode file viewer  
<hr>

The bytecode viewer is written in pure Lua.  
It's running here under [Fengari](https://fengari.io/) (Lua interpreter written in JS).  

The bytecode files are not being uploaded somewhere; processing is performed locally (inside your browser).  
The web page was tested only in FireFox.
