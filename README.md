Lua bytecode file viewer  
<hr>

The bytecode viewer is written in pure Lua.  
It's running inside your browser under [Fengari](https://fengari.io/) (Lua interpreter written in JS).  
The bytecode files are not being uploaded somewhere; processing is performed locally.  

The viewer can also convert your bytecode to another endianness, platform word size and Lua number size.  
Converted bytecode pertains to the same Lua version as original one.
