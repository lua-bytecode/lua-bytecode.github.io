Lua bytecode file viewer  
<hr>

The bytecode viewer is written in pure Lua.  
It's running inside your browser under [Fengari](https://fengari.io/) (Lua interpreter written in JS).  
The bytecode files are not being uploaded somewhere; processing is performed locally.  

The viewer can also convert your bytecode file to another endianness, platform word size and Lua number size.  
Note: It can't convert bytecode from one Lua version to another  :-)
